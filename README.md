# hello-world
Because I can do it, it is possible.

I observed as I gradually moved from an average student to an excellent student student. This was not by chance. It was as a result of determination, sleepless nights, hardwork but most important was the desire to finish what I had started. I was never the first to understand the topic, not the first to start asking questions. I was slow, but only at the start because the focus was to gain understanding. Once I did that, there was no stopping me.
